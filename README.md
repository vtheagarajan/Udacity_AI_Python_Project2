# Udacity_AI_Python_Project2
This is the 2nd project in Udacity's 'AI Programming with Python' Nanodegree

## Objective
Implement an image classsifier using PyTorch to classify flowers.  You will use a trained model and update the classifer / fully connected layer, so that it can be trained on 102 different flower categories.

### Part 1 of the project
In Part 1 of the project, the code was developed in Jupyter Notebook

### Part 2 of the project
Use the code developed in Part 1 to create two Python files:
1. train.py
- Should be able to call this from the command line and train the model on the flower imgaes
2. predict.py
- Should be able to call this from command line, passing in the path to an image of a flower and get output of flower category and probability of prediction accuracy.
